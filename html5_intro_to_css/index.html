            combat based MMO noone has had the ability tocreate one quite as successfully as BDO was able to. Side note the servers are still up and going strong it releases

        <h3>BlackDesertOnline Classes</h3>        
        <p>Classes the classes in BDO are pretty diverse with a large  26 playable classes with 24 of those classes having 2 different specializations that 
            make the class play differently depending on which style you decide to pick. Also within the clases there is a large amount of customization options 
            mainly focused on the body hair eyes etc and instead of using a basic page of 30-40 templates BDO usese a molding system where you can pull push drag and set the 
            character up out you see fit and make many minute changes to the class. Now some of the negative the classes are genderlocked which does 
            turn some people off of the game but that is partially because of how outfits and costumes work in the game as well as each character has
            a story tied into the class for example when playing a character called sage you arent one of many you are the specific one from the story. As the classes are intergrated
            fairly well into the world the full list will be found under the story information.
