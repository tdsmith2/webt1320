    </ul>
    <p>a bit of an overused gimmicks but as many know within DND as well as other types of table top role playing games. there are three well known types of players in the genre one 
        has a specific set of dice that they love either due to luck. the second type doesn't seem to ever own their own dice so they always borrow some from a friend then blams bad rolls on the 
    dice and asks for a different set every role untill they get the one lucky one. and finally the third is the most infamous dubbed the "dice goblin" these types of players, live by the creed of
pretty rock goes clickity-clack and be fun.</p>
<h3>The 2 types of dice goblins </h3>
<p>With dice goblins the types of players you normally see them run into two themes onet of having either one crown royale bag full of a random assortment of dice that they then pour onto the table 
    befor taking 10 minutes to seperate everything not knowing what all dice they actually have and going on their on little scavenger hunt to find. or you get the second type which is 
    they bring in a ton of little boxes with each dice set properly placed in its own spot because using two dice from different sets is bad juju and will mess the whole game up.
